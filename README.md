(More of an honourable mention at this point)\
GDCelestial by Ivanoovii. I ported their implementation to Unity and rewrote parts to work in 3D in the first version of this I did for a uni project. Very little of their code still exists in this project by now as most of it had to be rewritten but they were an incredibly helpful springboard and reference early on.\
